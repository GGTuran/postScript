## What is Postgresql?

**PostgreSQL**, often referred to as **Postgres**, has been in active development since 1989 and has evolved into one of the most robust relational database management systems available today. Known for its **ACID compliance** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), it ensures the reliability and integrity of your data. PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. Its advanced features like **complex queries**, **foreign keys**, **triggers**, **updatable views**, **transactional integrity**, and **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)** make PostgreSQL a top choice for a wide range of applications, from small web apps to large enterprise systems.

And because of the liberal license, PostgreSQL can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.

## What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

A **database schema** in PostgreSQL serves multiple important functions:

1. **Facilitating Multi-User Access:**

   - Allows many users to utilize a single database **without interfering** with each other.

2. **Organizing Database Objects:**

   - Schemas help organize database objects into **logical groups**, making them more manageable.

3. **Isolating Third-Party Applications:**
   - You can place third-party applications in separate schemas to **avoid naming collisions** with other objects.

> Schemas in PostgreSQL are analogous to directories in an operating system, with the key difference that schemas **cannot be nested**.
